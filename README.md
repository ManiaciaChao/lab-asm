# lab-asm

This repos is used for HUST `x86 assembly` lab, including my implements.

No license and guarantee here. Use at your own risk.

These codes are basically junk, and the only reason I wrote them is to make teacher happy :)

## Requirement

All files are Intel format and tested under MASM.

You may need a DOS emulator for the first 4 labs. Check [hust-asm-bundle](https://github.com/ManiaciaChao/hust-asm-bundle).

You must have a Windows environment for lab5.
